This page gives a very brief tutorial on the Scala programming language.

## Classes, Traits, Objects and Packages

### Classes

Classes in Scala are very similar to classes in Java. They are templates containing fields and methods. Like in Java, there can be many "instances" (or "objects") of the same class.

In Scala there exists a special kind of class named `case` classes. You will learn about case classes during the course.

Classes in Scala cannot have static members. You can use objects (see below) to achieve similar functionality as with static members in Java.


### Traits

Traits are like interfaces in Java, but they can also contain concrete members, i.e. method implementations or field definitions.


### Objects

Object in Scala are like classes, but for every `object` definition there is only one single instance. It is not possible to create instances of objects, instead you can just access the members (methods or fields) of an object using its name.


### Packages

Adding a statement such as `package foo.bar` at the top of a file makes the code in a file part of the package `foo.bar`. You can then do `import foo.bar.*` to make everything from package `foo.bar` available in your code. The content of a package can be scattered across many files. If you define a `class MyClass` in package `foo.bar`, you can import that specific class (and not anything else from that package) with `import foo.bar.MyClass`.

In Scala, everything can be imported, not only class names. So for instance if you have an `object baz` in package `foo.bar`, then `import foo.bar.baz.*` would import all the members of that object.

### _Hello, World!_ in Scala

Here are two ways to define a program which outputs "Hello, World!" in Scala:
   @main def helloWorld =
     println("Hello, World!")

or

   @main def helloWorld(args: Array[String]) =
     println("Hello, World!")

In Scala, the `main` or entry point method is defined in an top-level function.


## Source Files, Classfiles and the JVM

Scala source code is stored in text files with the extension `.scala`. Typically Scala programmers create one source file for each class, or one source file for a class hierarchy: In fact, Scala allows multiple classes and objects to be defined in the same source file.

- The name of a Scala source file can be chosen freely, but it is recommended to use the name of a class which is defined in that file.
- Package hierarchies should be reflected in directory structure: a source file defining `class C` in package `foo.bar` should be stored in a subdirectory as `foo/bar/C.scala`. Scala does not really enforce this convention, but some tools such as the Scala IDE for eclipse might have problems otherwise.

The scala compiler compiles `.scala` source files to `.class` files, like the Java compiler. Classfiles are binary files containing machine code for the Java Virtual Machine. In order to run a Scala program, the JVM has to know the directory where classfiles are stored. This parameter is called the "classpath".

If you are using eclipse or sbt to compile and run your Scala code, you don't need to do any of the above manually - these tools take care of invoking the Scala compiler and the JVM with the correct arguments.



## External Documentation

There is a large number of online resources available for learning Scala. The [Learning Resources](?page=LearningResources) wiki page contains a few links that we think are the most useful for our class.
