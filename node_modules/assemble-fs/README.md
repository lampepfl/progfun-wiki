> Assemble plugin to add methods to assemble for working with the file system, like src, dest, copy and symlink.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save assemble-fs
```

This is an assemble core plugin, you probably won't need to use this directly.

## Usage

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');

// create your application and add the plugin
var app = assemble()
  .use(require('assemble-fs'))

// now you can use `src` and `dest`
app.src(['foo/*.hbs'])
  .pipe(app.dest('site/'))
```

## History

**v0.6.0**

* emit `end` on `app` when stream ends

**v0.3.0**

* breaking change! plugin is wrapped in a function that now be called when registered. e.g. `fs()`. This is to be consistent with assemble's plugin guidelines, and allows the plugin to be auto-loaded following the same format as other plugins.
* rename `files` array to `streamFiles`
* adds `onStream` middleware handler to `src`
* adds `preWrite` middleware handler to `dest`
