> Extends vinyl files with properties used in vinyl-collections.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save vinyl-item
```

## Usage

Use the same way you would use a [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) file:

```js
var Item = require('vinyl-item');
var item = new Item({path: 'foo'});
```

## API

### [Item](index.js#L32)

Create an instance of `Item`. Optionally pass a default object to use. See [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) docs for API details and additional documentation.

**Example**

```js
var item = new Item({
  path: 'foo.html',
  contents: new Buffer('...')
});
```

**Params**

* `item` **{Object}**

### [.content](index.js#L215)

Normalize the `content` and `contents` properties on `item`. This is done to ensure compatibility with the vinyl convention of using `contents` as a Buffer, as well as the assemble convention of using `content` as a string. We will eventually deprecate the `content` property.

**Example**

```js
var item = new Item({path: 'foo/bar.hbs', contents: new Buffer('foo')});
console.log(item.content);
//=> 'foo'
```

### [.engine](index.js#L237)

Getter/setter to resolve the name of the `engine` to use for rendering.

**Example**

```js
var item = new Item({path: 'foo/bar.hbs'});
console.log(item.engine);
//=> '.hbs'
```
