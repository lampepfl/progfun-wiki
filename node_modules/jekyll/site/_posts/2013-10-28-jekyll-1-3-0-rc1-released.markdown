Jekyll 1.3.0 is going to be a big release! In order to make sure we
didn't screw anything up too badly, we're making a release candidate
available for any early adopters who want to give the latest and
greatest code a spin without having to clone a repository from git.

Please take this prerelease for a spin and [let us
know](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/new) if you run into any
issues!
