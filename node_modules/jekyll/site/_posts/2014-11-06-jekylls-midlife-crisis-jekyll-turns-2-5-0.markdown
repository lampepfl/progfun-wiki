A new day, a new release! Jekyll just turned 2.5.0 and has gained a lot of
wisdom along the way. This 2.5.0 release also comes just a few weeks after
Jekyll turned 6 years old! In fashion, we're celebrating this huge
milestone with a pretty big release. What's changed in 2.5.0? Here are some
highlights:

* Require plugins in the `:jekyll_plugins` Gemfile group (turned off with an environment variable)
* YAML Front Matter permalinks can now contain placeholders like `:name`. Check out all the placeholders on the [Permalinks docs page](/docs/permalinks/).
* The `jsonify` filter now deep-converts arrays to liquid.
* Shorted `build` and `serve` commands with `b` and `s` aliases, respectively
* WEBrick will now list your directory if it can't find an index file.
* Any enumerable can be used with the `where` filter.
* Performance optimizations thanks to @tmm1's [stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof)
* Fix for Rouge's Redcarpet interface
* Security auditors will love this: path sanitation has now been centralized.
* Specify a log level with `JEKYLL_LOG_LEVEL`: debug, info, warn, or error.

...and a whole bunch of other fixes and enhancements you can read more
about in [the changelog!](/docs/history/)

*When was the [first commit to Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commit/d189e05d236769c1e5594af9db4d6eacb86fc16e)?
All the way back on October 19, 2008. It features interesting historical
tidbits, such as the old name for Jekyll was "autoblog", and was first
released via Rubyforge. What a difference 6 years has made!*
