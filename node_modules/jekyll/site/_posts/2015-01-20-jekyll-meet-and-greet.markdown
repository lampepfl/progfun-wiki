Hey! Our friends at GitHub have agreed to host a Jekyll meet & greet on
**February 5, 2015 at 7pm**. The event will be hosted at
[GitHub's Headquarters](https://goo.gl/maps/Bmy7i)
here in San Francisco, CA. Pizza & beer will be available for those interested,
and there will be much time to sit and chat about all things Jekyll. This would
be an especially good time to get help with bugs you've encountered or to talk
over a potential feature with the core team in attendance.

A special thanks to [@gjtorikian](https://github.com/gjtorikian) for making this
all possible! You rock.

We look forward to meeting all you fine folks. Cheers!
