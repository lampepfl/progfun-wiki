Hey!

Exciting news! First beta for Jekyll 3 is out. Check out the [sizable
changelog](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/v3.0.0.beta1/History.markdown#head)
to get a feel for what changes are afoot. Key features:

1. **Speed.** Jekyll now features incremental regeneration and greatly
   improved problematic code that caused slow-downs.
2. Gobs of bugfixes and customization.
3. Uniformity and sanity to Jekyll extensions of Liquid.

To install just run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll --pre
{% endhighlight %}

Future versions will include [some awesome new
features](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3324) that we haven't
built yet. If you see one you want to tackle, submit a PR & you'll be
featured in the Jekyll 3.0 release post as a contributor to that epic
release.

Please file bugs as you encounter them, being sure to include your version
of Ruby, the Jekyll version, and (if possible) a link to your site so we
can reproduce.

If you think there's room for improvement in the UX, also do let us know.
We're always looking to make Jekyll easier to use!

Happy Jekylling!
