Hot on the heels of v2.5.0, this release brings relief to our Windows
users. It includes a fix for a 2.5.0 path sanitation change that has been
confirmed to work on Windows.

To our Windows users: while we don't officially support Windows, we don't
wish to impede your normal use of Jekyll at all. Our lack of full support
for Windows is due to our lack of a Windows machine for development testing
(no one on the core team has a Windows machine upon which to test new
release candidates), not due to any malice or willful oversight. If you
come to us with an issue, we are more than happy to work through it with
you to come to a solution that works for all platforms. Along those lines,
we have created a [**Windows Test Force**][] (WTF) which is a group of Jekyll
users dedicated to making sure all future releases work on Windows *before*
they're released so we don't have this issue again. A special thanks goes
out to the initial WTF team members, XhmikosR, Julian Thilo, Pedro Rog√©rio,
and Alfred Xing.

Happy Jekylling!
