About a month after the release of Jekyll v1.3.0, we are releasing
Jekyll v1.4.0. This release will be the last non-patch release to support Ruby
1.8.7 and our next release will be Jekyll 2.0.0.

Here are a few things we think you'll want to know about this release:

* TOML is now a supported markup language for config files.

* Maruku has been updated to 0.7.0 which provides some new features and
  a ton of bugfixes over the previous 0.6.x releases.

* Non-`gem` Plugins are now sorted alphabetically by filename before they're
  processed, which can provide a rudimentary way to establish a load order for
  plugins.

For a full run-down, visit our [change log](/docs/history/)!

As always, Jekyll wouldn't be possible without the contributions from
others in the Jekyll community. We'd like to thank the following people
for contributing to this release: Anatol Broder, David Sawyer, Greg
Kar√©kinian, Jordon Bedwell, Matthew Iversen, Persa Zula, and Yi Zeng.
