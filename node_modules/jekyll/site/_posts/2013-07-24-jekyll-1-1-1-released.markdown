Coming just 10 days after the release of v1.1.0, v1.1.1 is out with a patch for the nasty
excerpt inception bug ([#1339][]) and non-zero exit codes for invalid commands
([#1338][]).

To all those affected by the [strange excerpt bug in v1.1.0][#1321], I'm sorry. I think we
have it all patched up and it should be deployed to [GitHub Pages][gh_pages] in the next
couple weeks. Thank you for your patience!

If you're checking out v1.1.x for the first time, definitely check out [what shipped with
v1.1.0!][v1_1_0]

See the [GitHub Release][] page for more a more detailed changelog for this release.
