This release fixes [a regression][] where Maruku fenced code blocks were turned
off, instead of the previous default to on. We've added a new default
configuration to our `maruku` config key: `fenced_code_blocks` and set it to
default to `true`.

If you do not wish to use Maruku fenced code blocks, you may turn this option
off in your site's configuration file.
