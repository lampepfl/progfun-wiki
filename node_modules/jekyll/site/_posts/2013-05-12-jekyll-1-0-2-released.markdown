* Backwards-compatibilize relative permalinks ([#1081][])
* Add `jekyll doctor` command to check site for any known compatibility problems ([#1081][])
* Deprecate old config `server_port`, match to `port` if `port` isn't set ([#1084][])
* Update pygments.rb and kramdon versions to 0.5.0 and 1.0.2, respectively ([#1061][], [#1067][])
* Fix issue when post categories are numbers ([#1078][])
* Add a `data-lang="<lang>"` attribute to Redcarpet code blocks ([#1066][])
* Catching that Redcarpet gem isn't installed ([#1059][])
