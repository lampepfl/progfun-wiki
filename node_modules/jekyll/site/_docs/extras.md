There are a number of (optional) extra features that Jekyll supports that you
may want to install, depending on how you plan to use Jekyll.

## Math Support

Kramdown comes with optional support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) within math blocks. See the Kramdown documentation on [math blocks](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#math-blocks) and [math support](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/converter/html.html#math-support) for more details.

## Alternative Markdown Processors

See the Markdown section on the [configuration page](/docs/configuration/#markdown-options) for instructions on how to use and configure alternative Markdown processors, as well as how to create [custom processors](/docs/configuration/#custom-markdown-processors).
