Jekyll provides built-in support for Sass and CoffeeScript. In order to use
them, create a file with the proper extension name (one of `.sass`, `.scss`,
or `.coffee`) and start the file with two lines of triple dashes, like this:

{% highlight sass %}
---
---

// start content
.my-definition
  font-size: 1.2em
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file
will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you
have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site's source folder, Jekyll
will process it and put it in your site's destination folder under
`css/styles.css`.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Jekyll processes all Liquid filters and tags in asset files</h5>
  <p>If you are using <a href="http://mustache.github.io">Mustache</a>
     or another JavaScript templating language that conflicts with
     the <a href="/docs/templates/">Liquid template syntax</a>, you
     will need to place <code>{&#37; raw &#37;}</code> and
     <code>{&#37; endraw &#37;}</code> tags around your code.</p>
</div>

## Sass/SCSS

Jekyll allows you to customize your Sass conversion in certain ways.

Place all your partials in your `sass_dir`, which defaults to
`<source>/_sass`. Place your main SCSS or Sass files in the place you want
them to be in the output file, such as `<source>/css`. For an example, take
a look at [this example site using Sass support in Jekyll][example-sass].

If you are using Sass `@import` statements, you'll need to ensure that your
`sass_dir` is set to the base directory that contains your Sass files. You
can do that thusly:

{% highlight yaml %}
sass:
    sass_dir: _sass
{% endhighlight %}

The Sass converter will default the `sass_dir` configuration option to
`_sass`.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>The <code>sass_dir</code> is only used by Sass</h5>
  <p>

    Note that the <code>sass_dir</code> becomes the load path for Sass imports,
    nothing more. This means that Jekyll does not know about these files
    directly, so any files here should not contain the YAML Front Matter as
    described above nor will they be transformed as described above. This
    folder should only contain imports.

  </p>
</div>

You may also specify the output style with the `style` option in your
`_config.yml` file:

{% highlight yaml %}
sass:
    style: :compressed
{% endhighlight %}

These are passed to Sass, so any output style options Sass supports are valid
here, too.
